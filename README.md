## About
So this will a open-source search engine which will provide better results in a organized manner and will let users customize it however they feel like it. There will be ML (Machine Learning) invloved in this project (I will update the readme after I am done with the actual readme, this is just a draft for now).

For Now this will be entire terminal based or software based but will not be website based because I do not have money to pay for the website hosting and domain, unless you guys want to help me by sending me money then I will get a web hosting and will register a domain as well. And if I get enough money, from work (in the future) or from you guys then I will also release a mobile version of it as well :) 

## Update (May 29 2021):
HonorsPy - https://github.com/roshanlam/HonorsPy is the Search Engine I made during my first Honors Class. Will update the code here with the HonorsPy code once my Prof. has graded it

# Tools And Languages To Use
I want this project to be simple as possible but yet fast as well which is why most of the core functionalities will be coded in python. There might be some C/C++ so it can be fast but not sure about that right now. We will also use design patterns and will create algorthims of our own as well. 


# AI 

There will be an AI like Google or Siri or Alexa etc, which will search things for you when you say the following -> 

"Hey ____, Who is Donald Trump?"

or 

"Hey ____, What is the derivative of ______ ?"

Currenty The Name is Rey, but that's only temporary for now.
